To run my amazing game  follow these steps:

config:
	1. Move the folder this file is in onto your Desktop

	2. open terminal and type in cd Desktop/Game\ Folder then hit enter

	3. type chmod +x Game.jar then hit enter

	4. type chmod +x run.sh then hit enter

to run:
	1. if you haven't already or you have opened a new terminal window repeat step 2 	in config

	2. Drag run.sh onto the terminal then hit enter
	
	2. Instead of the step above you could right click on run.sh then click open with then find terminal and open it with that, then set it so that it always opens it with terminal. then all you need to do is click on it.
